* <h4><b> California Housing Data Analysis Project </b></h4> 
  This project contains multiple analyses and visualizations based on the 1990 California Housing dataset, sourced from Kaggle. The project explores relationships between key housing attributes such as house age, median income, and proximity to the ocean, and their impact on median house values. The analyses are split into five tasks, each focusing on a different aspect of the data, such as descriptive statistics, missing value analysis, and regression analysis.
