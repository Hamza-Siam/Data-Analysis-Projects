* <h4><b> Investigating Data Attributes that are Necessary for House Price Prediction </b></h4> 

  This project focuses on the application of machine learning and data analytics techniques to predict house prices. By analyzing a dataset with multiple attributes such as location, housing characteristics, and socio-economic factors, the project aims to build a robust predictive model. The goal is to utilize regression techniques, including linear regression and advanced methods, to estimate the housing prices and understand the key factors influencing them. Through this project, we explore various feature selection and data pre-processing methods to optimize the modelâ€™s performance and achieve accurate predictions.

* <h4><b> California Housing Data Analysis Project </b></h4> 

  This project contains multiple analyses and visualizations based on the 1990 California Housing dataset, sourced from Kaggle. The project explores relationships between key housing attributes such as house age, median income, and proximity to the ocean, and their impact on median house values. The analyses are split into five tasks, each focusing on a different aspect of the data, such as descriptive statistics, missing value analysis, and regression analysis.

* <h4><b> Stock Trading Strategy Backtest </b></h4> 

  This project evaluates a stock trading strategy applied to historical data from five Australian stocks: ANZ, CBA, BHP, RIO, and WES. The strategy is based on the crossover of 5-period and 20-period moving averages of daily closing prices. The analysis includes backtesting the strategy from January 2002 to August 2018, calculating moving averages, executing buy/sell trades, and evaluating the performance of each stock using the strategy.
